    <span slot="content">
        I study Software Technology at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), and I work at Siemens.
        <br>
        In my spare time I work out, play the piano and spend time on my own projects.
        <br>
        My projects typically include playing around with Unity3D, deep learning and generally artificial intelligence.
